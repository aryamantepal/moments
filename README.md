# Moments 🎶📷

**Music for the photos you see.**

Moments is a minimalist web app where every photo tells a story through song. Capture how you felt in an instant by pairing your photos with the perfect track.

## What is Moments?

Think **Instagram meets Spotify** — a feed of photo moments, each paired with a song that defines the vibe. No filters, no endless scrolling, just pure emotional snapshots backed by music.

## Features

### MVP (Week 1)
- 📸 **Upload photos** with drag-and-drop simplicity
- 🎵 **Search and attach songs** from Spotify's catalog
- ✏️ **Add captions** to give context to your moment
- 🧭 **Browse a feed** of moments from friends
- ❤️ **Like and react** to moments that resonate

### Coming Soon
- 🌐 **Explore feed** — discover moments from the community
- 🏷️ **Mood filtering** — find moments by vibe (chill, hype, melancholic, etc.)
- 🤖 **AI song suggestions** — get track recommendations based on your photo
- 🔗 **Shareable story links** — send your moment to anyone, even non-users
- 👥 **Friend system** — follow people whose taste you love

## Tech Stack
